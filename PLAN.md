# PLAN.md — COSMOS77-thief build plan (phase map)

The master spec is `../../CLAUDE_CODE_PLAYBOOK.md`; this file is the repo-local map of its §5
phases to PRDs, gates, and branches. One phase per branch (`phase-N-<slug>`), merged to main at
gate-green; every phase mirrors into `../COSMOS77-cop` (role code differs, `protocol/` synced
verbatim). Never advance on a red gate; never weaken a gate to pass it.

| Phase | Branch | PRD | Deliverable | Gate (must be green) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | main (bootstrap) | — | Repos, uv/py3.12, skeletons, kit verified | uv sync + pytest + ruff clean ×2; kit 113/113 vectors + 6/6 selfplay | ✅ 2026-08-07 |

## Strategy thesis (why we expect to win — playbook §4)

Provable floor: the bare 4-neighbor board is thief-win (C4 retract ⇒ cop number ≥2), so our thief's
35-step survival is guaranteed vs any single cop. Constructed upside: our cop turns the transmitted
scent grid into an exact position oracle (argmax inversion, kit-measured 224/224) and wins by
barrier region-shrinking against imperfect thieves. Expected series: ~90–30 vs belief-based teams;
47–47 (`series_add`) vs kit-grade optimal teams. Every friendly measures which bucket the opponent
is in before the counted run.

## Working agreements

- TDD; all LLM/MCP/network/Gmail I/O mocked in tests; deterministic seeds.
- Conventional Commits by the humans (alternating authors, cross co-author trailers, no AI
  trailers).
- Zero hardcoded tunables — config only. Secrets never in git (rules 39–40).
- Interpretation decisions recorded ADR-style in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (lands Phase 10).
