"""A4/A6: the sealed intent is MEASURED after the fact, and the token budget is a hard stop.

The audit scored a live series and found 31% of hints declared ``lie`` while the statement was
TRUE about our own half — the flag was drawn from an RNG before any text existed. It also found
nothing anywhere comparing consumption against the negotiated ``token_budget_per_series``.
