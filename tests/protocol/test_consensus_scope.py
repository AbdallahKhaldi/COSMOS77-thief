"""The settlement preimage is the reference's FIVE-key row — pinned so it cannot drift back.

The kit itself documented a six-key row (with ``tie``) from 2026-08-04 to 08-13 — the exact
window this project was built in — and this repo shipped it.  Every hash ever settled live
reproduces only under five keys; a six-key signer fails settlement against every played
implementation, and on a counted series that is rule 35: zero for BOTH teams.
