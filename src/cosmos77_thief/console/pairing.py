"""Everything an opponent needs, derived once and formatted to paste — pure, no I/O.

Pairing is the most error-prone step of the whole league: the ``game_uid`` must be derived from
the flat signed terms (not the whole config), the ``game_id`` sorts the pair, the window map has
to say who dials whom, and the turn order has to be stated because no protocol lock covers it.
Getting any of those wrong is invisible until two reports are diffed, after the games are over.
So the console derives all of it and writes the message for you.
