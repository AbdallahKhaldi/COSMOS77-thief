"""Per-turn JSONL event stream — the hub viewer's data source, LOCAL TRUTH ONLY.

One line is appended per ``on_view`` callback, so the file is exactly the sequence of moments
the mandated live GUI draws (rules 8-9: our own state and our own inference, never the
opponent's true position). The sink runs synchronously inside the turn loop, so it must never
add a failure mode to a real game: every write is append+flush, and every error is swallowed
and counted, never raised.
